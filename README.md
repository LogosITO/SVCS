**SVCS (Simple Version Control System)** is an educational and research project aimed at implementing the fundamental principles of a distributed version control system (similar to Git) from scratch using C++.

The main goal of the project is to gain a deep understanding of core concepts:

- **Immutable Objects:** Creating and handling objects (`Commit`, `Blob`, `Tree`) based on a single abstract `VcsObject` class.  
- **Data Integrity:** Applying cryptographic hashing (**SHA-256**) for data identification and verification.  
- **Clean Architecture:** Implementing OOP principles, inheritance, polymorphism, and separation of concerns.

## üöÄ Current Project Status: Core Functionality Stable

The project has evolved beyond initial memory stability to a functionally robust core.  
The primary object model (`Blob`, `Tree`, `Commit`) is complete, and a basic command-line interface is now operational, supported by an event-driven logging system.

### Major Achievements
- ‚úÖ **Complete Object Model:** `Blob`, `Tree`, and `Commit` are fully implemented and stable.  
- ‚úÖ **Operational CLI:** A stable command-line interface for user interaction.  
- ‚úÖ **Event-Driven Logger:** A flexible logging system implemented with the *EventBus* pattern.  
- ‚úÖ **Memory Safety:** Free of critical memory errors and leaks (confirmed with Valgrind).  
- ‚úÖ **Strong Data Integrity:** Repository objects are hashed and verified using **SHA-256**.

## üó∫Ô∏è Next Steps

Future development will expand the feature set:

- Expand CLI commands (`svcs log`, `svcs status`, `svcs checkout`, `svcs branch`)  
- Branching and merging functionality  
- Remote repositories (push/pull support)
