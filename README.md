# üìö SVCS: Simple Version Control System

This **SVCS (Simple Version Control System)** project is an **educational and research effort** aimed at implementing the fundamental principles of a distributed version control system (similar to Git) from scratch using C++.

The main goal of the project is to gain a deep understanding of core concepts:

* **Immutable Objects:** Creating and handling objects (`Commit`, `Blob`, `Tree`) based on a single abstract `VcsObject` class.
* **Data Integrity:** Applying cryptographic hashing (presumably SHA-1) for data identification and verification.
* **Clean Architecture:** Implementing OOP principles, inheritance, polymorphism, and separation of concerns.

## üèó Key Implemented Components

The core foundation of the system is currently implemented and tested:

* **Object Model (`VcsObject`, `Blob`, `Tree`, `Commit`):** The complete object model, including serialization and deserialization capabilities.
* **Object Storage (`ObjectStorage`):** The class responsible for **reading, writing, and managing** the lifecycle of VCS objects on disk. It handles Zlib compression/decompression and data integrity checks.
* **Hashing Utilities:** Implemented a static helper for computing **SHA-1** hashes of Git-format object content.

## üöÄ Build and Technologies

| Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **C++ (C++17+)** | Primary programming language |
| **CMake** | Build system and project management |
| **Google Test** | Unit testing framework |

## üõ† Project Status and Next Steps

The project is currently under active development.

* **Current Focus:** Comprehensive testing and stabilization of the **`ObjectStorage`** module.
* **Next Stage:** Implementation of the **`Index` (Staging Area)** class to track files in the working directory and prepare data for commit creation.
