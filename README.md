# 📚 SVCS: Simple Version Control System

This **SVCS (Simple Version Control System)** project is an **educational and research effort** aimed at implementing the fundamental principles of a distributed version control system (similar to Git) from scratch using C++. 

The main goal of the project is to gain a deep understanding of core concepts:

* **Immutable Objects:** Creating and handling `Commit`, `Blob`, and `Tree` objects based on a single abstract `VcsObject` class.
* **Data Integrity:** Applying cryptographic hashing (presumably SHA-256) for data identification and verification.
* **Clean Architecture:** Implementing OOP principles, inheritance, polymorphism, and separation of concerns.
