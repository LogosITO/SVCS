\doxylink{classBaseCommand}{Base\+Command} implements the logic for interacting with the \doxylink{structEvent}{Event} Bus system, allowing all derived commands to easily generate informational, debug, and other messages that will be automatically processed by registered observers (e.\+g., \doxylink{classLogger}{Logger}).
