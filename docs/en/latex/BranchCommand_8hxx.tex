The \doxylink{classBranchCommand}{Branch\+Command} is the interface for the \textquotesingle{}svcs branch\textquotesingle{} command. It supports various branch operations, including listing existing branches, creating, deleting, renaming, and switching branches. It relies on the \doxylink{classBranchManager}{Branch\+Manager} for core logic and the \doxylink{classISubject}{ISubject} event bus for user communication.
