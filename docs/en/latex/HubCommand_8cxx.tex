This file provides the concrete implementation for the \doxylink{classHubCommand}{Hub\+Command} class. The {\ttfamily execute} method handles the logic for\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries{Argument Validation}}\+: Ensures exactly one valid path is provided.
\item {\bfseries{Filesystem Checks}}\+: Verifies that a repository doesn\textquotesingle{}t already exist at the target location.
\item {\bfseries{Directory Creation}}\+: Creates the target directory and the full {\ttfamily .svcs} "{}bare"{} repository structure (objects, refs, hooks, etc.).
\item {\bfseries{File Seeding}}\+: Writes the initial {\ttfamily config}, {\ttfamily HEAD}, and {\ttfamily description} files.
\item {\bfseries{Notifications}}\+: Uses the \doxylink{classISubject}{ISubject} event bus to report success, info, or error messages. This command uses the {\ttfamily \doxylink{classRepositoryManager}{Repository\+Manager}} dependency indirectly, as the logic is simple enough to be self-\/contained filesystem operations, but it relies on the manager\textquotesingle{}s path conventions.
