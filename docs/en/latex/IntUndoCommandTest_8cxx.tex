This file defines the setup and teardown routines for the \doxylink{classUndoCommand}{Undo\+Command} integration test fixture, along with helper methods to simplify test case creation by automating file and directory creation, staging, committing, and output verification. \begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
The {\ttfamily simulate\+User\+Input} method currently contains a placeholder comment, as mocking {\ttfamily std\+::cin} requires more complex setup, which is omitted here. For full interactive testing, the command/event bus must support injectable input streams.
