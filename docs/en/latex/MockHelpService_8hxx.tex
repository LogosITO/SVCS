This class inherits from \doxylink{classHelpService}{Help\+Service} and overrides its abstract methods ({\ttfamily get\+Available\+Commands}, {\ttfamily get\+Command\+Description}, {\ttfamily show\+Command\+Help}) with controlled implementations. It includes utility methods ({\ttfamily set\+Available\+Commands}, {\ttfamily was\+Command\+Help\+Called}, etc.) to allow tests to configure the mock\textquotesingle{}s behavior and inspect its interactions. This mock is essential for unit testing the {\bfseries{\doxylink{classHelpCommand}{Help\+Command}}} without depending on the actual implementation of the CLI command registration system.
