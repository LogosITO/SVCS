This class handles file path construction, serialization, Zlib compression/decompression, and acts as a factory for restoring concrete \doxylink{classVcsObject}{Vcs\+Object} types (\doxylink{classBlob}{Blob}, \doxylink{classTree}{Tree}, \doxylink{classCommit}{Commit}). It uses an injected \doxylink{classISubject}{ISubject} for internal event logging.
