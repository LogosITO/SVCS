\doxylink{classRepoCommand}{Repo\+Command} implements the \doxylink{classICommand}{ICommand} interface to manage repository-\/level configurations, primarily focusing on managing {\bfseries{remotes}}. This command acts as a facade, delegating the actual management of remotes to the \doxylink{classRemoteManager}{Remote\+Manager} class after ensuring the command is executed within a valid repository context (implicitly handled by \doxylink{classRepositoryManager}{Repository\+Manager}). The command supports subcommands like {\ttfamily add}, {\ttfamily remove}, {\ttfamily list}, and {\ttfamily rename}.
